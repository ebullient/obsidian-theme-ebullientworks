# Welcome to Ebullientworks Obsidian Theme ðŸ‘‹

This is a dark and light theme for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md), a note taking app. 

I've begged/borrowed/stolen CSS snippets from just about everywhere, but I started from vanilla and tried to be judicious about what to include to keep things lean. Modals and other panels are also styled. All colors are sourced from [this palette](colors.md)

Headers are styled and sized (for mobile and not) with and without Sliding panes (and rotated headers).

Some light styling has also been applied for the following community plugins: 

- admonition
- calendar
- day planner
- sliding panes
- timelines
- tracker
