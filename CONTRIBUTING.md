## Reporting a bug

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). 

1. Before opening an issue, please check to make sure you're using the latest version of the theme.
    ```
    Settings -> Appearance -> find Themes, and click the "Manage" button. 
    ```
    Verify that `Ebullientworks` is the selected theme, and use the Update button to refresh it.

2. Toggle enabled snippets on and off to see if the intersection of those is causing the problem

3. Toggle plugins on and off to see if one of those is causing the problem (the fastest way is
  to temporarily enable safe-mode. If the issue does not occur when all plugins are off, use the
  "[binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) process of elimination" to 
  figure out which plugin has conflicting styles.
  
When you open the issue, include a screenshot or other short screen recording of what you see,
and include any information you gathered from steps 2 and 3 so we can figure out how to get everything
to play nicely. ;)

## PRs

Pull Requests are welcome! This theme uses Sass (`npm run build` to update the `obsidian.css` file). 
Try to keep changes as compact as you can, and avoid using `!important`.

Thank you! 🍻
